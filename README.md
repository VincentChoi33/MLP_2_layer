# MLP_2_layer

Construct 2-layer perceptron with MNIST data set from Kaggle.


Use ReLU as activation function, softmax to classify, cross entroy as cost function

The goal is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.


For every in the test set, you should predict the correct label.
